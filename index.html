      <h1>Crafting</h2>

      <p>
        Crafting is a creative activity that involves making objects with your hands, and it can have many benefits.
        There are many different types of crafting, including crocheting, sewing, knitting, embroidery, 
        jewelry making, card making, candle making, chocolate making, soap making, and baking. 
        Crafting can also be a way to express your culture and the lives you lived. Archaeologists 
        often value ceramics more than other precious treasures because they can tell the story of
       daily life at a site.
